STATUS REGISTER
The status register is an 8-bit read-only register at I/O address hex 64
that holds information about the state of the keyboard controller and interface.
It may be read at any time.


OUTPUT BUFFER
The output buffer is an 8-bit read-only register at I/O address hex 60. 
The keyboard controller uses the output buffer to send the scan code received 
from the keyboard and data bytes required by command to the system.
The output buffer should be read only when the output buffer full bit in the register is 1.



INPUT BUFFER
The input buffer is an 8-bit write-only register at I/O address hex 60 or 64.
Writing to address hex 60 sets a flag that indicates a data write;
writing to address hex 64 sets a flag that indicates a command write.
Data written to I/O address hex 60 are sent to the keyboard
(unless the keyboard controller is expecting a data byte)
following the controller's input buffer only if
the input buffer full bit in the status register is set to 0.
